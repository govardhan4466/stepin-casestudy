## INTRODUCTION :
.The main aim of the project is to check wheather a person is seating in seat or not, by using the sensors.And again changing the temperature of the car seats for required temperature .

. Most of these days technology is growing and peoples are expecting more technology systems.

.In this project system is about obeserving persons  and changing the temperature in the module is main thing.
                
  ## FEATURES : 
  .At first we have check wheather person is seating or not by using sensors, and check the heater.
  
  .After that it gives us indicition, and determine heat.
  
  .After the determination of heat and person can change the temperature by seeing in the display and adjust is as of the required                     temperature.
                
   ## SWOT Analysis- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats:
   
   ## STRENGTH: 
   .Easily usable
   
   . cost less
   ## WEAKNESS:
   .It can't be used in the high temperature areas
               
   ## OPPORTUNITIES:
   .We can change the requirements of dectecting temperature by replacing with the air conditioners.
                
   ## THREATS:  
   .it is not suitable in high temperature.

   ## 4W'S AND 1'H :
   
   ## WHAT:
   Seat management and temperature management system.
           
   ## WHERE:
   It can be used in industry(automation).
          
   ## WHEN:
   It can be used in low temperature areas.
            
   ## HOW:
   It can operated by manually by person in car.
